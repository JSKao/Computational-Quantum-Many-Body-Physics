    "U(1) charge conservation + dipole conservation seems to be minimum requirements for a system to evade equilibrium. As a system with energy conservation would equilibriate to the symmetry sector of energy(microcanonical ensemble), wouldn't the system with charge and dipole conservation equilibriate to the corresponding symmetry sector of U(1)? It's shown by a quantum circuit model that charge is localizazed, not spreading. Such unconventional localization happens without energy conservation and disorder, where Anderson localization does, was explained in 2020. It was explained by the existence of exponentially large number of eigenstates of the charge+dipole symmetry Hamiltonian, in which the charge and dipole are localized. In  operator language, time evolve unitary matrix is block diagonalized into symmetry sectors(blocks), and for non-ergodic system each block will further block-diagonalized into exponentially many small size blocks. This is called Hilbert Space Fragmentation. Different tiny blocks don't talk to each other even if they are in the same symmetry sector."

In a lab, the majority of observations we can make are two-point correlation(In amo lab, it might be 10-point correlation function, but still finite). As we can only observably determine thermaliztion, an initial out-of-equilibrium state loses its information into non-observable operators as time evolve, or in other words its information is hidden in those non-observable operators, and finally reaches a thermal state. In standard quantum mechanics books as how it is taught, systems are small, like an electron in a wall or atom, hermitian operators are all observables, thus no such idea as thermal equilibrium in such small system.

    "The most common one is under the realm of hybrid quantum classical models. (1) Quantum circuits is parametrized and let classical processors control the parameters to perform the tasks of Variational quantum eigensolver(VQE) and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). (2) Design a structured quantum circuit. So that quantum circuit is a quantum model and quantum data generator just like other quantum simulators."
