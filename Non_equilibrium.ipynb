Such unconventional localization happens without energy conservation and disorder, where Anderson localization does, was explained in 2020[Sala,et al, 2020]. It was explained by the existence of exponentially large number of eigenstates of the charge+dipole symmetry Hamiltonian, in which the charge and dipole are localized. In operator language, time evolve unitary matrix is block diagonalized into symmetry sectors(blocks), and for non-ergodic system each block will further block-diagonalized into exponentially many small size blocks. Different tiny blocks don't talk to each other even if they are in the same symmetry sector."

    "It's useful to examine thermalization from quantum operators point of view. It's essential to realize that almost all hermition operators in quantum many body systems are not observables. In a lab, the majority of observations we can make are two-point correlation(In amo lab, it might be 10-point correlation function, but still finite). As we can only observably determine thermaliztion, an initial out-of-equilibrium state loses its information into non-observable operators as time evolve, or in other words its information is hidden in those non-observable operators, and finally reaches a thermal state. In standard quantum mechanics books as how it is taught, systems are small, like an electron in a wall or atom, hermitian operators are all observables, thus no such idea as thermal equilibrium in such small system.
