# Research notes

Notes and literature collections for some research directions, continuously being organized and expanded:

Non-equilibrium quantum many body physics in [`Non_equilibrium.ipynb`](https://github.com/JSKao/Computational-Quantum-Many-Body-Physics/blob/main/Non_equilibrium.ipynb). 


Pactice entanglement and topology of quantum many body physics in [`Entanglement_Topology`](https://github.com/JSKao/Computational-Quantum-Many-Body-Physics/blob/main/Entanglement_Topology.ipynb)
