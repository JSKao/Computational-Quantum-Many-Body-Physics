# Notes on QMBP
Literature review and research interests are in the growing document [`NonEquilibrium_Quantum.ipynb`](https://github.com/JSKao/Computational-Quantum-Many-Body-Physics/blob/main/NonEquilibrium_Quantum.ipynb). 

Tensor network and quantum circuits note is in [`TensorNetwork_Topology.ipynb`].

Pactice numerical simulations of quantum many body physics.
